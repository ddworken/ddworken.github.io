#The List

Over the past 2 months, I've spent some time working on bug bounties. In the past two months, I have found vulnerabilities in the following websites: 

* AT&T
* Adobe
* Dyn
* Go Daddy
* Western Union
* Symantec
* IBM
* Vistaprint
* Hobby King
* Tumblr
* Haiku Learning
* Mozilla
* Maret
* eBay
* iFixIt
* MailChimp
* Amazon
* Steam
* Netflix
* Appcelerator
* mail.ru

So far most of these companies have responded and they have either patched or they are actively working towards patching the vulnerabilities. Once these companies approve public disclosure, I will be adding write ups for each vulnerability to the bottom of this blog post.
