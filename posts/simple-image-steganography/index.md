StegIm is a simple program for image steganography. For example, I encoded the phrase ```Hello world!!!``` into [tree.png](http://blog.daviddworken.com/tree.png) to create [encodedTree.png](http://blog.daviddworken.com/encodedTree.png). When looking at the below images it is impossible to tell the difference between them despite additional data being hidden in the second one.
